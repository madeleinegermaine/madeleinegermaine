Share Thanksgiving is an organization that pairs new Canadians with established Canadian families to share a holiday meal. I was a City Leader for the program's first year in Ottawa, Ontario. I ran a successful communications campaign to promote the program that resulted in coverage from local television, radio and print media. 

We were able to match over 80 new Canadians, a very high number for the program's first year.
