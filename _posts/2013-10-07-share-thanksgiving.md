###Share Thanksgiving Ottawa###

In 2013, I ran communications for Share Thanksgiving Ottawa, an organization that pairs new Canadians with established Canadian families for a holiday meal. Our campaign resulted in coverage from local television, radio and print media. 

Thanks to our media coverage, host family recruitment was a great success. We matched over 80 new Canadian families in our first year in Ottawa.
