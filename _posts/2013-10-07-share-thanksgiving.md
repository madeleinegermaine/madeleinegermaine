###Share Thanksgiving Ottawa###

I was City Leader for Share Thanksgiving Ottawa, an organization that pairs new Canadians with established Canadian families for a holiday meal. I ran a successful communications campaign that resulted in coverage from all local television, radio and print media. 

Our organization matched over 80 new Canadian families in its first year in Ottawa.
