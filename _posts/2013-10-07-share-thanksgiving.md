###Share Thanksgiving Ottawa###

I ran communications for Ottawa's first [Share Thanksgiving](http://www.sharethanksgiving.ca/), an event that pairs new Canadians with established Canadian families for a holiday meal. Our campaign resulted in coverage from local television, radio and print media. 

Recruitment was a great success, and we matched 100 new Canadian families in our first year in Ottawa.
