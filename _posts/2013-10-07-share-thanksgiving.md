#Share Thanksgiving Ottawa#

I was City Leader for Share Thanksgiving Ottawa, an organization that pairs new Canadians with established Canadian families for a holiday meal. I ran a successful communications campaign that resulted in coverage from all local television, radio and print media. 

Our organization was able to match over 80 new Canadians in Ottawa, a very high number for the program's first year in the city.
