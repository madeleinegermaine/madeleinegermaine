Extensive development along Bronson Street between Clemow and Powell avenues has converted unused OCDSB property into much needed central housing. The project is commissioned by Charlesfort Developments, the company responsible for The Glassworks loft condominium at Greenfield and Main streets. Developer Doug Casey heralds the new Powell Lofts as a "great improvement" to the site. The property will be further beautified, Casey says, to include trees, shrubs and extensive wrought-iron fencing.

The total development at the site consists of six townhouses and a 44-unit loft condominium. Only four of the loft units, with prices ranging from $197,000 to $287,000, remain unsold. Further construction at Bronson Street and Powell Avenue of The Glasgow, a six-storey condominium, will begin in March 2004. All of the projects have underground parking, so the influx of new residents should not affect parking availability on the streets west of Bronson. As many of the units are one- and two-bedroom, it is expected that a large percentage of the tenants will be single-occupancy, with some families moving into the townhouses.

"The Glebe is a great area," Casey says. In its promotional material, Charlesfort Developments stresses the central location with proximity to Bank Street businesses and many local schools.

Dean Verger, owner of local landmark Rasputin's Café on Bronson, has mixed feelings regarding the development: "People living closer to work is always a good thing," he says, as more central housing can reduce inner-city traffic. He is concerned, however, that the new development could increase traffic along Bronson and possibly result in new safety concerns. The concerns Verger expresses resonate with recent community action regarding the high-speed and often dangerous Bronson Street traffic.

The shift from the old Borden School site to a residential area is one of many changes along Bronson Street lately. Nearby businesses have seen substantial turnaround: the Fiesta Café has closed and been replaced by Fluid Colour Concept Salon, the Doozy Candle Company has relocated to a Byward Market location and been replaced by Midearth Travel Inc. The conversion of the unused site to housing will change the Bronson Street dynamic, although it is still unclear what direction the change will take.
