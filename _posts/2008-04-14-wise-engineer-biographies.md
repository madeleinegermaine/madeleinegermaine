###Claudette Mackay-Lassonde###

Claudette Mackay-Lassonde believed that engineers could make a difference. Her work, both in the public and private sectors, reflected her desire to to bring engineers out of the shop and into the community. She dedicated her working career to advocating for the harmonious integration of technology and society, a combination that she believed would bring progress and positive growth to Canada.

The oldest of six children, Mackay-Lassonde had an early window into the world of technology. Her father, a mechanic at CanRon, a Montreal company that produced electric motors, was an important figure in her life. Though as a woman her choice to become an engineer would result in derision from some of her colleagues, Mackay-Lassonde was steady in her path. Her father, himself familiar with the shop floor, supported her choice to push her way into the “boys' club” of engineering. This support, along with her own determination, propelled Mackay-Lassonde to the top of the world of engineering and into the public sphere. 

Mackay-Lassonde spoke of the difficulties she faced as a female engineer, and of the attacks she endured during her studies in the late 1960s. From the beginning, she was aware of the need to carve out a place for herself. Mackay-Lassonde ignored warnings to reign in her intelligence, such as one indictment from a male student not to try too hard in her studies because male students “hate women that do well in engineering.” 

In 1971, she graduated at the top of her class. She then went on to complete a Master’s Degree in Nuclear Engineering from the University of Utah in 1973, as well as an MBA from the University of Toronto in 1983. After her studies, Mackay-Lassonde worked across the sector with corporations such as Bechtel Power Corp in San Francisco, Atomic Energy of Canada, Ontario Hydro, Northern Telecom, Xerox, and Enghouse Systems Ltd. 

Mackay-Lassonde saw technology as the future of social and economic development, and believed that engineers should be integrated into community decision making.  She said, “I think we forget that human need caused the development of technology. Technology was not developed to replace humans, but to help humans.” To this end, Mackay-Lassonde held a Vice-Chair position at Sunnybrook Hospital and at Queen’s University, and she was on the Administrative Council at Wellesley Hospital. Believing that governments needed more Members of Parliament with scientific backgrounds, Mackay-Lassonde ran for the Liberal Party in the Ontario provincial elections of 1987.

Mackay-Lassonde recognized the struggles facing women engineers in their professional lives. She was a leader in the fight to make room for women in the profession. In 1977, Mackay-Lassonde founded WISE: Women in Science and Engineering, a group that encourages and supports women who seek education and employment in science and engineering. In 1991, Mackay-Lassonde created a $15,000 scholarship for female doctoral students in engineering in response to the 1989 Montreal Massacre at the École Polytechnique de Montréal.   Speaking of her 1986 position as the first female president of the Association of Professional Engineers of Ontario, Mackay-Lassonde said in 1996, “As the first female president of the engineering association of Ontario, I was reminded that my mandate was to deal with professional issues, not advance a feminist cause… Throughout these episodes one basic belief has consistently led me to stand up and speak up for the right to make our own choices. Not every woman aspires to a career in engineering or to reach the top of the profession, but those who do should be given a fair shot.”

Mackay-Lassonde made room for herself and for other women in the world of engineering. Her work was recognized across the country by seven honorary doctorates. She changed the face of Canadian engineering. In the words of her son, engineer Christian Lassonde: “My mother believed in our responsibility to promote change that could build a better world. At the core of this, she believed that engineers have a responsibility to create or transform discoveries to bring about a better life for people.” 

Mackay-Lassonde died in 2000.

###Claire Deschênes###

Claire Deschênes knows the importance of role models. In 1989, she was hired as the first female engineering professor at the University of Laval in Quebec City, but during her time studying mechanical engineering as an undergraduate, Deschênes was the only female student in her program. Now, as a professor of engineering, she maintains that increasing the participation of women in engineering begins with convincing young women that there is a place for them in the profession. Deschênes says, “When a woman who works in the sciences enters a classroom to talk about her career, it opens horizons. It makes things palpable. The impact is major, but we suffer, especially in the applied sciences, from a severe shortage of female role models. We must remedy this.”

In her work promoting in science and engineering education to women, Deschênes has undertaken many initiatives. She collaborated with teens to publish _Folles du Génie_, a book about female engineers that is directed at a young audience. At Laval, Deschênes organized lunchtime meetings for science and engineering students, with panels, round tables and guest speakers, to encourage dialogue and awareness. She takes her work beyond her own university to participate in events across the province of Quebec for the promotion of women’s participation in science and engineering.

Deschênes works to increase women's engagement in engineering both within and outside the scientific community. Deschênes represents AFESTIM (_Association de la francophone à propos des femmes en sciences, technologies, ingénierie et mathématiques_). As a member of the Women in Engineering Committee of the Quebec Order of Engineers, and the Multidisciplinary Feminist Research Group (GREMF), she is often consulted by the media to speak on issues of women’s participation in science and engineering. Recently, Deschênes was made a member of the Council on the Status of Women.

Deschênes is actively involved in the teaching, research and development of engineering. At Laval, she teaches fluid mechanics and turbomachinery for the Mechanical Engineering Department. Her research is focused on hydraulic machines and turbines. She created and directs the Hydraulic Machines Laboratory (LAMH) at Laval. Projects of international scope have come out of this laboratory, including the creation of a test bench for micro- and hydraulic turbines. 

Claire Dechênes is committed to building a future in engineering that includes women, and her work has been noticed. In 2002, Claire Deschênes was awarded the Canadian Engineers’ Award for the Support of Women in the Engineering Profession. With her commitment both to making technical advances and to promoting science and engineering as a viable path for young women, Claire Deschênes is an example of how to make the applied sciences socially relevant.
