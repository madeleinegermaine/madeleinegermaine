###My Last Year of University - #YesAllWomen###
  
  

I was sexually harassed by two professors in my last year of university.

Overlapping, one per semester. I have trouble telling this story.

**Andrew**

I found him attractive. He was small and muscular with a shaved head. He stared at me in class and pinned me to my seat.

I spent my time studying at the archives. He spent his time working at the archives.

“Can I sit with you?”

I knew where this was going.

“Come have dinner with me.”

_No, I can’t. No, I’m busy. I’m not hungry. I have stuff to do.
I don’t think it’s a good idea._

Just come. Just say yes. Come. You should come. It’s late. Come eat. Come. Just say yes.

_OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK._

I don’t remember the order of everything.

I remember getting a tour of his work and him rolling up his sleeves.

I don’t remember the transition from finding him attractive to being afraid of him.

I remember getting an email every September for a few years, wondering what I was up to.

There was a yes and a no. The no was first. I shouldn’t have had to work so hard for that no.

He knew. Everyone knows. Don’t hit on your students. It’s not rocket science.

He told me I should go to teachers college. Forget grad school.

He liked to talk about my fucked up family. He was saving me.

I spent nights at his place. He was rough. Grabbing me. No food in his house. A delirious time. Crying on the living room floor late at night.

Angry at me for finding my mark on the stack of exams on his desk.

I can’t explain the feeling:

Why is it worse this way?

The first time.

No talking.

He flips me over.

I am face down on his bed, his hand over my mouth, my arms pinned behind my back. A wave of panic. I open and close my hands until he lets go.

He lets go.

Would it have been different if he had just wanted to fuck me gently?

Unlike the kind of rough sex I like, this was not just some bedroom game.

He wanted to dominate me all over. The sex was a detail.

I was beautiful, young, smart, small, at his mercy.

The ambiguity: wanting that roughness, but not that way.

It took me years to figure out that I could have that with safe people.

It took me years to start to feel safe again. Still, it’s a struggle. I work at it every day.

It’s hard for me to talk about this: where my responsibility lies. I said no and I said yes. For anyone else, I would know. I would be able to tell them, this was abuse. He was abusing his power. He was wrong. And I know these things, in one way, but it does not feel so easy when the story is about you.

**Gabriel**

He made me cry in class. He humiliated me on purpose. I said something he thought was stupid.

I found him attractive, too. He reminded me of my father.

Next class, he caught me at break.

“I want to give you some advice about your future.”

Something about grad school. Picking the right stream. He knows. He knows everything. He will tell me over dinner.

I say yes because I have never said no in my whole life.

We drive around in his car for three hours while he rants about his ex-wife. I am different. He knows I am in love with him, he says, because when a woman cries it means they are passionate. He has a connection with me. I dress badly, though. Canadian women are sexless.

Eyes on the road. This isn’t really happening.

“I guess I have to give you an A now or else you’ll whine to the department.”

I spend the rest of the year, sitting in his class, in panic, eyes on my desk, getting in late and rushing out as soon as class is over, avoiding him on campus, and turning the other way whenever I see someone who looks like him on the street.

I hand in the course evaluation blank. Multiple choice. There is nowhere to write, “This professor sexually harasses students.”

I didn’t tell anyone at the school. I was afraid of making myself a target. I would be accused of making false accusations, of being a trouble maker. I was harassed by two professors. No one would believe me. I was the theme. It was me. I did it.

**Here is the theme: women experience sexual violence every day.**

There’s nothing wrong with us. We are ok. But we are not safe at work, at home, on the street, or at school. It’s hard to see the big picture when you are fending off situations that leave you feeling hopeless, tight, worthless.

I want to be able to tell this story better. This is a good start.
