###Out of Sight###  


“This sucks, Aria. Let’s go.”

“I still have half my drink!”

“Bring it with you.”

Julie and Aria started out of the party and into the night. Julie was older than Aria by six months. Aria was the most drunk she had ever been in her life, though she was new at it. Her head was floating.

“Where are we going, Jujube? Is this your idea of fun, dragging my ass out into the middle of nowhere? They had buckets full of chips in there.”

Julie pulled a pack of cigarettes out of her sweater pocket. She flipped the top open, pulled out two cigarettes and lit them both with her lighter.

“Sip your drink and smoke this. You won’t be hungry anymore.”
Aria narrowed her eyes at Julie and took the cigarette. “So where we going?”

“Top of the hill. 15 minutes. Do you think your legs can handle it?”

Aria nodded sloppily. “I’m as steady as a horse. My boots were made for walking. You just lead the way and where you lead, I will follow.”

Julie laughed. Aria was never short on words in a way that pleased Julie, who herself was quiet and measured. She said everything without embellishment and was often the first to end a conversation or leave a party. Aria was always looking for the next adventure. Julie wished she could find it in herself to be a little less stiff, a little goofier. She brushed the thought away and took another drag off her cigarette. “Watch your head, that branch is low and your legs are too long.”

“They’re just right. I’m made for this nature shit. How much longer, Jules?”

“Keep walking shortie and I’ll tell you when we get there.”

The two veered off the long, treed street where the party was being held. Their classmate’s parents were out of town and the evening was predictable. Julie had been at parties like that before. She knew that if she had stayed another half hour, some neighbour would have had enough of the noise and call the police. Around the same time, some freshman would have had enough of the coolers and start throwing it all up on the lawn. This was the natural progression of life. Julie knew when to make her exit.

The neighbourhood was surrounded by woods. It was far enough outside the city to feel isolated but not so far that you couldn’t reach it with a bicycle and a little willpower. The woods separated the city from the patch of swirly streets and large lawns dotted with above ground pools. The trees rose up the hill and into the sky. The woods quickly became dense as Julie and Aria started climbing, dappling and then closing out the street lights with November bare limbs. The orange glare was replaced by a silvery and swollen moon. 

These were real trees, not the scrub you see by the side of a highway when passing quickly through town. Aria, who spent most of her year on the baked dusty streets of their neighbourhood, was intrigued by the thick and gnarled trees. “Wait a sec, Jules. Come here.” Julie was walking ahead, leading the way, and slowly turned around. Aria grabbed the top of Julie’s hand and placed it up against the thick, cool bark of a birch. She put her own hand against the tree and patted it like and animal.

“It’s alive. Can you feel it?”

Julie nodded. She liked the trees in these woods, too. She had been here before, and knew it had a kind of magic late at night. She had wondered if Aria would find the buzzing, talking, hum of the trees for herself.

Julie watched as Aria moved her face closer to the tree, tilting her head from side to side as if she was looking for something, and then pushing up to it so that her cheek was pressed gently up against the side of the trunk. She leaned into the tree and closed her eyes. Her ear and her chest were resting against the tree. She was wrapped around it.

“I can hear its heartbeat. Feel.”

Aria grabbed Julie’s hand and made space for it between the trunk and her chest. Julie could feel the hum of the tree, her hand and Aria’s warm body all wrapped together. She felt a tightness move into her chest and a lump in her throat. She felt warm and dizzy. Julie pulled her hand away from tree and smacked Aria’s shoulder.
“Keep walking, pipsqueak,” Julie said. “We just have farther to go.”

Aria whispered goodbye to the tree and unwrapped herself. She looked up and squinted at the stars – no glasses for the party - and grabbed onto Julie’s hand as she trailed behind her.

“I feel dizzy,” Aria said. “Make sure I don’t fall or you might have to carry me.” 

She had ditched her drink in the bushes behind the party house and was just starting to feel too drunk. She could feel herself tramp heavily on the dirt path, and she tried to be careful as she picked up and placed each foot down again in front of her, avoiding the lumps and turns of tree roots that grew along the path.

Aria was turning her head all the way to the left and all the way to the right, craning her neck up at the bare branches that formed a dense canopy above them. 

“Where’re we going, Jules? Where’re you taking me? My feet are slow.”

Aria was not used to being the one on the following side of a scheme. Julie and Aria had known each other for six years, and in that time Aria was always the one taking them places. Aria had a way of being able to convince anyone to do anything. In elementary school, she made boys give her their hockey cards through her sheer determination that they would be better off hers. She didn’t even like hockey: she leaned the cards up again the walls of her dollhouse, life sized cutouts for the tiny doll women that lived there, to feed and boss around. 

“Your feet look big to me. We’ll be there soon.”

Julie gave a small tug at Aria’s hand and got her moving again on a forward clip like a stubborn pony.

“Well,” Aria said. “If you’re not going to tell me where we’re going, tell me something else. Tell me three things you learned at the party.”

“Sam thinks I’m pretty, you’re leaving town, and that kid with red hair made out with his cousin,” Julie said.

“His red-haired cousin?”

“Weird, hey? They should know better than most cousins not to do it. Their babies might come out like beets. Aria, are you really leaving town?”

Aria sighed and squinted sideways at Jules while they climbed. “Who told you that? It’s only a maybe. Anyway, it’s not really up to me.”

They had been climbing for five minutes and the fresh air had started to wake them both up. Aria’s cheeks were red, not from the drinks but from the climb and Julie did not have to drag her anymore. The two moved quickly up the steep hill together.

It had been a wet fall. Julie’s boots were muddy up to the ankles. Aria had twigs stuck to the long, pale cream socks that stuck up out of her sneakers. She had leaf crumples in her hair from when she had taken a seat against, and then laid down under, a tree just long enough to make the world stop spinning for a moment.

“That party was lame,” Aria said, “and Sam is a tool.”

“Sam is a tool, but I’m still pretty, right?”

Just as Aria was about to answer, they came through to the edge of the trees and reached a clearing at the top of the hill. The hill divided the main corridor of the city from the suburbs and the way they had come was steep and forested. The way down to the city was long and craggy but no trees. The winds in the town blew the scrub small and twisted so that no trees could really grow. Aria had never been up so high above the town before.

“Let’s sit,” Aria said, and tugged Julie down onto the soft patch of earth. Aria could feel Julie’s fingers cold and stiff, pulled up into her sleeves. She pulled her sweater out from under her jacket, reached down into the deep pockets, pulled out a pair of dollar store gloves and handed them to Julie. Julie pulled them on and then blew on her hands, heating up the gloves with warm air.

“So where are you going?”

“It might not happen. My dad got a job, and I think my mom is deciding: go, or don’t.”

“Like divorced?” Julie asked.

“Like pretending to be together when really you are not. I think that’s the way it is, whether she goes or not. Either she pretends here, or she pretends there. I wish she’d stop pretending.”

“So where are you maybe going?”

“You’re not going to believe me,” Aria shook her head slowly. 
“Santa Fe.”

“New Mexico?”

“I told you it was ridiculous.”

Julie’s head was suddenly flooded with a deafening sound, a loud thrum like a single isolated note from a car alarm. It felt like an emergency. Aria could not move to New Mexico.

“Why didn‟t you say something, Aria?”

“Cause in my head it’s not true and I am manifesting my destiny. It’s just going to keep not being true to me until it’s not true to everyone else. I didn’t tell you cause that would make it truer. So for the record, this conversation is all theoretical and hypothetical and we’re just sitting here like two normal people trying to pull it together before we head home so that our parents don’t know all the bad teenager stuff we’ve been doing.”

“I don’t want you to move,” Julie said. It was true enough that it came through clearly above the noise in her head and out of her mouth without resting, like most words did, just behind her lips so she could decide if they were just right.

“My mom is fickle. She threatens but she has no follow through.” Aria was trying to convince herself as much as she was trying to convince Julie. The effort made her tired and cold. She focused her gaze on Julie and said, “Forget it. Just be quiet for a sec.”

They were each huddled beside each other, twisted up to keep the warmth in. Aria had her hands tucked into her thick sweater and Julie wore a knit hat. They were dressed like sheep, sloppy and woolen. Aria turned around on the grass and inched closer to Julie so that they were facing each other. “To keep warm,” she said as she nudged Julie’s legs to unlace, and then laced them through hers. She stuck Julie’s still-cold hands inside the sleeves of her sweater and rubbed Julie’s small arms with her hands. Aria’s hands were always burning.
“A pretzel,” Julie said.

“Exactly,” Aria nodded and pulled her sleeves farther up Julie’s arms. The building heat made Julie feel sleepy. She closed her eyes and imagined the Santa Fe sun on her skin. She was standing in the desert and the sun was low on the horizon. She shielded her eyes with her land and looked far to the west, where it was setting behind a cactus. A rattlesnake snickered by.

Julie came out of it with a start. “Jesus, what a cliché.”

“Huh?” Aria wiggled her nose out of the cowl of her sweater and stared at Julie. 

“Aria,” Julie started. She knew it was going to be irrational. “You’re going to get a stupid haircut. You’re going to get a tan. You’re probably going to get pregnant by some loser with a truck. He’ll call you ‘babe’ and wink and everyone.” Aria was watching Julie with slow eyes, trying not to laugh. “You’re going to fit in. You’re going to change.” Julie had worked herself up and pulled her arms out from the inside of Aria’s sweater. The cold found its way up her sleeves and down the sides of her body. She felt foolish and tired. Neither Julie nor Aria were that drunk anymore, and Julie wished that they were someplace warm, together. 

New Mexico without the rattlesnakes. A sweater big enough to fit the two of them.

“You’re going to forget me.”

Aria did not say anything. She was waiting to see if Julie had finished. The heartbeat in her ears made her swoonish, almost seasick. She had to struggle to feel steady on the ground underneath her. It was late but she was not tired. She was seasick with sad.

“New Schmexico. Look at me.”

Julie’s head was tilted to the side, trying to balance the precarious tear that had welled up fat along the bottom rims of her eyes. She was trying hard to not make a scene. She was exasperated, with herself, for saying the wrong things that did not fit at all.

Julie avoided Aria’s eyes. Aria moved one warm hand from her lap and placed it on Julie’s right cheek. Julie melted into the warmth, and she felt herself melt into Aria. The tears in her eyes were cold and overflowed, running down her cheek, pooling in Aria’s thumb.

“Jujube, you’re my sugar pie honey bunch. Soul sisters.” Aria pressed her cheek up against the other side of Julie’s face and warmed her cheeks from both sides. “I won’t forget you.”

“I know,” Julie said.

“No, you don’t. I have an idea.” Aria said. “Let’s leave before they can find us.”

The space inside Julie’s chest expanded so fast. “I have two hundred and eighty two dollars in my bank account,” she said, breathing the words out. Aria could never hold onto more than a few dollars at a time, and Julie felt a bit embarrassed at her outburst.

“I have two sleeping bags. I can drive,” Aria said.

“You have your permit?”

“Not exactly, but I can drive. We’ll keep to the back roads.”
Julie considered the proposition.

“This Wednesday,” Aria continued. “Tell your mom you're sleeping over at my house and I'll say I'm staying at yours. That way we'll have a night's head start. We can take the bus. I can drive but they'll know we're gone if I start stealing cars. And I don't know if I can do all the wirey bits. We'll be the world's most frugal fugitives.”

“We can get pretty far that way, under the radar,” Julie thought out loud. The plan was making sense to her. Aria and she would go on an adventure, and everyone they knew would be too stunned and too slow to catch up to them.

Julie heard a rustle in the bushes behind her, down the slope of the hill, and then voices. Julie looked at Aria to make sure that the noises were real, not just imagined in the wooded darkness between themselves and the  dim lights of the neighbourhood below them. 

“I hear it, too,” Aria said.

“Probably people from the party looking for somewhere to get stupid.”

“Stupider,” Aria said. The voices grew more boisterous as they approached Aria and Julie on the trail. Three loud whoops came from a boy’s voice, then a shrill shrieking from a girl. “Is that Jess?” Aria asked.

Julie was scanning the woods trying to figure out if there was a way to sneak back down the path without meeting into the group. She wasn’t in the mood to be interrupted.

“I guess we’ll see in a minute.”

Three teenage boys appeared around the corner all at once, stomping loudly. They did not notice Julie and Aria, who were sitting on a fallen tree log off the path, in the shadows. Sam, a tall boy who was in the same math class as Julie and not yet used to his own height, was limping slightly. There were crushed leaves stuck to the back of his sweater and in his hair. 

The three boys were still whooping. Tom, the largest of the three, picked up a large rock and hurled it into the brush, hollering loudly.

“They look like apes,” Julie whispered to Aria, “except apes can grow facial hair.”

“You guys are jerks!” Julie and Aria knew for certain that Jessica was with the group. Her voice was unmistakable, exaggeratedly pointed with each word she spoke. “You left me behind!”

“Make a break for it?” Julie asked, but it was too late. Jessica had rounded the corner and scanned the scene before her closely, rolling her eyes at the drunken boys and their antics, and zeroing in on Julie and Aria. She smiled widely at them, showing too many white teeth.

“I knew you two were lesbians,” Jessica said. “I’m glad you freaks found each other so that at least you leave the rest of us alone.”

Julie was bored with Jessica’s meanness. They had known each other since elementary school. Jessica had been a fussy child with a cringing whine and had not changed at all. Aria, though did not ever avoid a fight. She stood up and her legs wobbled underneath her body, but there was a fire in her eyes. She walked up to Jessica, and Julie could almost see Jessica start to shrink. “Jess, I’m sorry you’re too ugly for even one of those mouth breathers to find you attractive enough to walk with you, but I’m not going to play Ken and Barbie with you. Even if you want to be Ken. You’re not my type.”

Aria’s voice grew louder as she put Jessica in her place. Julie got up slowly, tired and ready to leave. She had pulled Aria into the forest to talk, and the party had followed them. Julie wanted to go home and she didn’t want to have to pull Aria out of a fist fight.

“Aria,” she started to say, hoping to distract her for long enough to start corralling her down the trail and back home, but stopped when she noticed that the three boys were watching them.

“Ladies!” Tom shouted. 

“Fellas,” Aria replied and, out of view of the boys, pursed her lips at Jessica in a kiss, mouthing to her, you’re lucky.

“Let’s go, Tom,” Jessica hissed and pushed through the brush to meet up with him, grabbing his hand and starting to pull him down the trail, “it smells here.” 

“Whoa, whoa, let’s show some courtesy to our fellow travellers,” Tom said, weaving slightly between his left and right feet. The third boy, smaller than Tom and Sam, was standing quietly behind the other two. Julie knew she had seen him but could not remember his name.

Julie grabbed Aria’s elbow and pleaded, “Let’s go.” The earth started to fall out from under Julie’s feet when she felt Aria pull, leaving a halo of heavy air in her place. Aria was gone for the evening, Julie knew, and instead of watching her from up close, Julie would have to watch out for her from afar, making sure Aria did not get into too much trouble.

“Hey, Tom,” Aria started. Tom had laughing eyes. He could be as mean as Jessica, but was so big he didn’t have to whine to get his way.

“I’m going!” Jessica huffed, but no one was listening. She teetered on her white shoes as she made her way over the rocks on the path. Her shoes were muddy and not meant for hiking, especially not in the winter. Julie felt sorry for her, and wished that she would stay, because she did not want to be alone, stuck between the pull of Aria and Tom.

“So what are you and moody doing out here in the woods?” Tom asked. “Aren’t you afraid of bears?”

“Lions and tigers, too, Thom-ass. It’s good you brought your boys with you, I hear wild animals like to pick on lone wanderers.”

Julie watched Aria teasingly push her small body against Tom, digging her feet into the ground, trying to push him into a tree. He did not budge. He turned towards Aria and grabbed her by the waist, hoisting her over his shoulder. Julie winced at the sight of it but did not move. Her head ached from the cold and the dull throb of the alcohol leaving her system.

“We got one. Let’s go, losers,” Tom called behind him to Sam and the boy whose name Julie did not know, as he started to head down the hill. Julie followed behind Tom and Aria, keeping her distance. Aria laughed and kicked at Tom as he carried her, lumbering down the hill. Julie could now and again make out the glow of Jessica’s cellphone that she was probably using to text her friends about how horrible Thomas was and the lesbian proof of Julie and Aria in the woods. Julie was glad at least that she could see Jessica down the path. 

Julie didn’t like being outnumbered by boys. Even harmless boys can be menacing, she knew. A few years earlier, Julie had been surrounded by a handful of boys from her class behind the school during lunch. One of them ripped her shirt when she pulled away from him while he tried grab at her chest. The bigger the tits, the bigger the slut, he said, and yours are huge. Julie kicked the boy hard in the shins and ran off, dropping her sandwich on the ground. Walking down the hill, Julie remembered the hunger that gnawed at her that day, and how foolish she felt for dropping her lunch. She felt her stomach growl and realized that she hadn’t eaten enough this day, either. 

“Julie,” the boy with no name called. He was walking behind Julie but she had been trying to ignore him, focus on Aria, and will Tom to return her to the ground safely. 

Julie turned to the boy and stared at him blankly. “Simon,” he said. Julie blinked and turned away. 

“Sorry about Tom,” Simon continued. “He’s an ass but he won’t hassle your friend.”

“Damn right he won’t,” Julie said, irritated that Simon had been able to read her mind, and not sure if she should find his words comforting or unsettling.

“We had math class together,” Simon continued,. “Last year, Mr. Matthew’s”

She didn’t remember.

“You helped me with that problem, the rollercoasters, remember? Acceleration?”

The whole math class was a blank in her memory. “Right. Rollercoasters.”

“I got a B+ on that test. That was the best mark I got all year,” Simon said. His eyes turned to Julie, while Julie watched Aria flop around over Tom’s shoulders. Aria was singing a song she didn’t know all the words to. Tom was tapping the beat on Aria’s legs and humming along, which gave Julie some hope that she wouldn’t have to rescue Aria, just drag her home once Tom finally did put her down. 

Julie could still make out Jessica in the distance and knew that they were near the end of the trail, almost back at the party. She thought about how relieved she would be to get home, which made her realize her jaw was clenched tightly, and that was causing the ache in her head. Julie took a deep breath and tried to relax, but the tightness just moved from her jaw to her stomach, making her hunger more insistent.

“I just wanted to thank you, Julie,” Simon said, bringing Julie back to the conversation. “You made it all make sense. You should be a teacher.”

Julie imagined herself teaching math to a group of unruly teenagers, instead of the regular good teacher idea of helping underprivileged orphans achieve academic success. Julie would have to show up to class every day, for the rest of her life, an adult but stuck in high school forever.

_Miss Teacher is so lovely, Miss Teacher is so kind
She doesn’t give us homework or make us stay behind._

Julie watched Aria wiggled down from Tom’s shoulder and grab his hand. She kept singing as the group made their way down the hill.

“You’re welcome,” Julie said to Simon. 

“We’re here,” Simon said.

The group had reached the bottom of the hill. Jessica disappeared into the house. The sky was just starting to lighten. Julie realized that she and Aria had been out for hours, but she was not cold anymore, just tired. 

“Jue-Jue,” Aria called back to Julie, “it’s tomorrow!”

“That doesn’t even make sense,” Julie heard Tom say, and she stepped a little faster to catch up with Aria.

“Your face doesn’t make sense,” Aria said, and in the same breath, “Jules, let’s go home.” 

..

Julie waited outside while Aria crept into the screened back porch of the party house to find her purse under a pile of coats and boots. Simon offered Julie a cigarette. She took it so that she would have something to do with her hands while she waited. 
By the time Aria made her way outside, the sun was starting to get high in the sky. “Me too,” Aria said, and Julie handed over her half-finished cigarette so that Aria could light her own from the ember. Julie could tell the daylight was giving Aria a second wind when she grabbed Julie by the hand and started to pull her down the street. Half way home, Aria slowed her pace.

“I feel sick, Jujube.”

“I know, Aria. We’re almost there. Just keep walking.”

The two reached Aria’s house first and stood on the walkway together, looking at the street.

“Want coffee?” Aria asked. “I've got instant.”

“I should head home. My mom’s probably worried about me,” Julie replied, but mostly she wanted to sleep. It had been a long night.

“Suit yourself,” Aria said, and smiled softly at Julie.

“See you later, Aria,” Julie said, and started home, not getting down the front path before she remembered.

“Your mitts.” Julie walked back to Aria and flashed the red, woolen mitts onhands.

Julie had walked all the way down the hill with her mittened hands stuffed into the pouch of her sweatshirt. Even so, her hands had long been numb to the cold. She handed them to Aria.

“Keep them,” Aria said, putting them back on Julie.

..

Julie walked the three blocks home from Aria’s house, balancing one foot in front of the other along the side of the curb. The cat was waiting at the front door after a night out in the cold. She opened the door quietly, letting the cat rush in ahead of her to make sure that the coast was clear.

Julie went into the house and was hit by the heat that had been turned on an hour earlier by the timer. It was soothing. She slipped off her shoes and walked into the kitchen where her cat was waiting by its dish. She ran the tap and poured herself a glass of water. Julie drank the water, leaning up against the refrigerator, put the glass in the empty sink, and walked up the stairs to her bedroom. Her feet sunk into the thick carpet and she was tempted to just lie down on the landing instead of climbing the stairs all the way up to the second floor. She heard her mother’s slow and heavy breathing from the hallway, still fast asleep.

Julie pushed the door open to her room. The sunlight was streaming in the window and cast a strong beam on her bed. Julie pulled her cold jeans off and pulled on a pair of sweatpants that were lying on the floor. She lay on her bed, on top of the blankets. The cat pushed its nose into Julie’s room, and hopped onto the bed, purring.

She still had the mitts in the pouch of her sweater. She pulled them out, placed them on her pillow and laid her head on top of them. The cat turned around once then settled into a curl. Julie put her hand on the cat and felt the vibrations move all the way up her arms and down to her toes. 

Julie closed her eyes and felt the warmth of sleep come over her. It came in waves, between flashes of the cold of being out in the night, in the dark, walking down a mountain, trying to keep up with her friend, only to melt back to the heavy warmth of being in her own bed, in her own house.

She slept until the smell of her mother’s percolated coffee woke her up. She hovered in half sleep for some time, trying to hold onto the dream she had not been able to finish. In her dream, Julie was standing alone in a field of snow up to her ankles. She was wearing a pair of black rubber boots but no jacket. She had goose bumps on her arms but she was not shivering. She stood in one spot, turning her head from side to side, trying to see if she could find her sweater off in the distance, unable to remember if she had even had one in the first place.

..

At school on Monday, Aria grabbed Julie by the arm in the hall just as the first bell started to ring.

“Ju-jube,” she said, “I was so sick yesterday. You don’t even know.”

“I can guess,” Julie said. “Did you sleep it off?”

“Nah, I drank soda until I replaced the hangover with a sugar rush and wanted to puke for a whole different reason. Did you have fun?”

Julie was not sure how to answer that question. “It was ok. I can’t really stand those guys, Tom and his friends.”

“They’re lame,” Aria said, “ but at least they’re cute.”

“They’re not that cute, Aria.”

“Yeah. Oh well. Julie,” Aria said. “I’m moving away.”

“I know, Aria.”

“I’m sorry Ju-jube.”

The second bell rang and before Julie could answer, Aria kissed her on the cheek and Aria ran off to class. “See you, Ju-jube!” 

By the time Julie called out, Aria was way down the hall, out of sight.
