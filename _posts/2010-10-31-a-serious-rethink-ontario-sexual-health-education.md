###A "serious rethink": the struggle to create sensible sex-education curriculum in Ontario###  


This spring, the Ontario Ministry of Education put forth ambitious revisions to its sexual health curriculum for public schools. These updates included age-appropriate information for children, such as teaching anatomically-correct names of body parts to first graders, introducing the concept of “invisible differences” like gender identity in the third grade, and discussing the physical changes of puberty in the sixth grade.

The proposed changes followed a 2009 study by the University of Toronto, York University and Planned Parenthood Toronto that called for comprehensive and age-appropriate sexual health education in Ontario. These changes would have propelled Ontario public schools to the forefront of evidence-based and medically-sound sexual health education programming. 

Instead, the provincial government failed to communicate its education strategy to stakeholders early on, and walked into a firestorm of backlash with little public relations planning or conviction of purpose. Reactionary opponents, like Rev. Charles McVety, president of Canada Christian College in Toronto, claimed that the curriculum changes were “part of a militant homosexual agenda” and rallied Conservative groups to protest the revisions. Premier Dalton McGuinty had not reviewed the changes before the few but vocal opposing factions were able to twist intent of the new curriculum. 

Prior to the controversy, the Ontario sexual health curriculum revisions underwent close scrutiny and were developed over two years in collaboration with health and education experts. Despite the care that went into the proposed revisions, and ignoring calls from experts like David McKeown, Toronto’s Chief Medical Officer, who said in a press release that students need “clear, unbiased, age-appropriate information and parents need the support offered by a strong sexual health program in schools,” Premier McGuinty backed away from the controversy and pulled the changes for a “serious rethink” before they were implemented. 

The standards set by Education Ministries across the country differ from province to province. British Columbia boasts the most comprehensive sex education curriculum in the country, with discussions of sexuality beginning in kindergarten. In Alberta, sex education begins in Grade 4, though homosexuality is not discussed until the ninth grade. This is not the first time that a sex education controversy has arisen in Canada. In 2005, New Brunswick faced a similar situation when the government sought to introduce an updated sex education curriculum that discussed subjects such as masturbation. Like Ontario, New Brunswick eventually scrapped the proposed changes.

Ontario's current model of sexual health education falls in the middle of pack in terms of Canadian curricula. It discusses contraception and pregnancy, and gives students information about HIV/AIDS. It is, however, outdated. A study by the University of Toronto and York University that surveyed over 1,200 Ontario high schools students, suggests that it is not providing youth with the information necessary to make healthy sexual choices. Sarah Ficker, professor of Environmental Studies at York University said, "Many kids were unsure about whether they had had sex or not, and even among those who were unsure, some reported that they had engaged in oral sex, anal sex or vaginal sex."

What happened? Where did we go wrong? 

Ontario had the chance to give children a modern and progressive sex education curriculum intended to foster self-respect, knowledge about ones' body and compassion for individual differences. How was a small group of opponents able to distort the message of the government, academics, health practitioners and educators so effectively? What lessons can we take from this example?

In Canada, same-sex marriage and abortion are legal, but North American culture is still largely sex-phobic. The anxiety that many have around sexual health allowed a small group of vocal opponents to derail a public health initiative. Anti-gay rhetoric like that of Rev. McVety should have been rejected wholesale by the government as a homophobic throwback, but was instead tacitly accepted when the government backed down. 

Moderate Ontarians who privately supported the proposed changes stayed largely out of the fray. Why was it easier for conservative forces to voice opposition to sex-positive education than it was for moderate groups to support it? We cannot promote honest and healthy communication for our children if we have not yet embraced it for ourselves. Young people carry the burdens of their culture – no one is born with a shame that leaves them afraid to negotiate condom use or to say no to unwanted sex, but this is the reality for young people today. By remaining silent, we pass this shame onto children. Sex education could focus on integrity, consent and pleasure. Instead, we send our children out into a dangerous landscape without the tools to navigate their relationships or define their identities in a healthy and positive way. 

It is our job to do better. Start now: call your Principal, call your School Board Trustee, call the Premier. Tell your friends that you support early, age-appropriate and comprehensive sex education for students. The health and well-being of young people is our responsibility. We let our children down when we act out of discomfort instead of in their best interest. If we hope our children grow into sage young adults who are empowered to make healthy decisions, we must ensure that they have access to information about their bodies and sexuality before it is too late.
