###Ottawa Solidarity Rally for New Brunswick Morgentaler Clinic###

In April 2014, the New Brunswick Morgentaler Clinic announced that they would be forced to close their doors due to lack of funding. 

Rallies were organized across the country in solidarity with the people of New Brunswick. 

I organized the Ottawa, Ontario rally. We had a turn out of approximately 150 participants on a rainy day and were covered by local television stations. 

I wrote the press release and introductory remarks seen below.

**Pro-choice activists hold solidarity rally to protest the closure of the Fredericton Morgentaler Clinic**

**Ottawa, ON** - On Saturday, April 26, at 2 PM, 200 local pro-choice activists are expected to rally on Parliament Hill to protest the closure of the Morgentaler Clinic in Fredericton, New Brunswick. Since the closure was announced on April 10 rallies have occurred across the country as pro-choice activists demand accessible abortion services for the people of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.

Under current regulation, women in New Brunswick must obtain approval from two physicians in order to qualify for a provincially funded abortion. There are no abortion services available in Prince Edward Island.

First opened in June 1994, the Morgentaler clinic provides support and abortion services to the women of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, offering free services for those who cannot pay. With the closure of the clinic, access to abortion services in New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island will be severely limited, causing outcries from human rights and pro-choice activists across the country.

Saturday's rally in Ottawa will include speeches from former Fredericton Morgentaler Clinic employees and local activists. Rally attendees will bring wire coat hangers to demonstrate the dangerous choices women are forced to make when access to abortion is limited.

Solidarity rallies have occurred across the country, as many activists voice concern for the health of women in New Brunswick and PEI. Ralliers are demanding the New Brunswick Legislature comply with the Canada Health Act and provide timely, affordable access to abortion services.

###Introductory Remarks###

The closure of the Fredericton Morgentaler Clinic is a shock that has sent pain rippling through this country.

We all know that if access to abortion is limited people will die. It breaks our hearts.

We are all here for one reason - to stand with the folks of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.

Because access to abortion is guaranteed to all people in Canada, and we need that promise to become reality.

Because there is no reproductive health care without abortion services.

Because we love New Brunswick and PEI, and they deserve better.

Because our voices will carry, along with those in Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, Halifax, St. John's and Charlottetown, all the way to Fredericton. Our voices will give strength to those working hard for justice, and our voices will make legislators toss in their sleep until they make this wrong right.

Because we are loud and we are angry. We are hopeful and we are full of love.  Our belief is strong and our voice is clear. It is our job to make noise until there is safe, free and timely abortion services for all, and we are ready to fight.

###Social Media Campaign###

New Brunswick provincial goverment politicians refused to speak on the closure of the Morgentaler Clinic. 

I participated in a social media campaign to target these politicians. I was the first and only person able to elicit a response from a Member of Provincial Parliament. 

The exchange seen below is an example of flippant attitude that the current New Brunswick government has for the health of its constituents.
