###Morgentaler Clinic, Fredericton, New Brunswick###

In June 2014, the Fredericton, NB Morgentaler Clinic announced that they would be forced to close their doors due to lack of funding. 

The New Brunswick government, in contravention with the Canada Health Act, refuses to fund the clinic. Dr. Henry Morgentaler, the Clinic's founder, insisted that no one was turned away for lack of funds and paid for medical services for those in need himself. With his death in 2013, the Clinic was no longer able to stay open without provincial funding.

Rallies were organized across the country in solidarity with the people of New Brunswick, and a social media campaign was organized. 

I organized the rally in Ottawa, Ontario. We had a turn out of approximately 150 people on a rainy day, and moving speeches from former Morgentaler Clinic employees, midwives, doulas, and academics.

Our rally was covered by local television stations.

####Social Media Campaign####

New Brunswick provincial goverment politicians, many of whom are in favour of restricting access to abortion, refused to speak on the closure of the Morgentaler Clinic. 

I participated in a social media campaign to target these politicians, and was the first and only person able to elicit a response - though unsatisfactory - from a Member of Provincial Parliament. [This interchange](http://nbprochoice.tumblr.com/post/87023959650/the-twitter-campaign-link-hoped-to-publicly) is an example of the lack of concern that the current New Brunswick government has for the health of its constituents.
