In the 2013 [Bedford Ruling](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/supreme-court-strikes-down-canada-s-prostitution-laws-1.2471572) the Supreme Court determined that Canada's sex work legislation was in violation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and struck it down.

In 2014, the Department of Justice conducted an online survey intended to shore up support for the recriminalization of sex work in Canada.

In response, I created [SafeSexWork.ca](http://safesexwork.ca) with artist/activist [Adam Brown](http://madanworb.com) as a tool to encourage local organizations and individuals to learn about the dangers to sex workers under the criminalization model, and to complete the survey advocating for complete decriminalization.
