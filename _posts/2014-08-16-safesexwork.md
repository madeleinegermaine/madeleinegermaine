In the 2013 [Bedford Ruling](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/supreme-court-strikes-down-canada-s-prostitution-laws-1.2471572), the Supreme Court struck down Canada's sex work laws, as they were determined to be in violation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Soon after, the Department of Justice conducted a Canada-wiede survey intended to shore up support for the recriminalization of sex work.

I created [SafeSexWork.ca](http://safesexwork.ca) with artist/activist [Adam Brown](http://madanworb.com) in response, as a tool to engage local organizations with the issue, educate them about the dangers to sex workers under criminalization model, and encourage them to complete the survey in support of sex workers' rights.
